I've been a developer since 2010, hacking on everything from big trading systems
to open-source libraries and the occasional side-project.  I arrived at software
development through non-traditional means, granting me valuable insights to
users, at the sacrifice of knowing the intricacies of lambda calculus and linear
algebra.

At my core, I'm committed to improving productivity and reducing complexity by
writing programs that delight people.
